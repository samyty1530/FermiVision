        "content": "<h3>Executive Summary</h3><p>A major multilayer PCB manufacturer in Shenzhen faced increasing complexity and demand for rapid, high-volume inspections across hundreds of board types. Traditional optical metrology systems required extensive manual programming and lacked flexibility.</p><p>Fermi Vision addressed this bottleneck by integrating CAD auto-programming and distributed offline workflow capabilities. Programming time dropped from hours to minutes, delivering significant gains in:</p><ul><li>Throughput - Faster inspection cycles</li><li>Equipment utilization - More productive machine time</li><li>Inspection consistency - Reduced human error</li></ul><p>This case underscores how Fermi Vision's intelligent software and hardware integration redefine performance standards in optical metrology.</p><h3>Background: The Legacy Limitations of Optical Metrology</h3><p>Optical metrology has long been essential for quality assurance in PCB and semiconductor production. While vision systems replaced slower, manual tools, they brought their own challenges:</p><h4>Manual Programming Overhead</h4><p>Legacy systems often require manual selection of features, alignment points, and measurement logic. For high-mix production environments, this means programming hundreds of unique jobs—a time-consuming, error-prone process.</p><h4>Lack of CAD Integration</h4><p>Many vision tools still operate independently of CAD environments, limiting automation and increasing rework.</p><h4>Offline Limitations</h4><p>Traditional systems often tie programming to the inspection station itself, reducing equipment availability and operator flexibility.</p><p><em>These limitations bottleneck yield, delay production, and strain inspection teams.</em></p><h3>The Challenge</h3><p>The customer in this case—a high-output multilayer PCB factory—needed a solution that could handle a wide array of board designs and sizes.</p><p>Key pain points included:</p><ul><li>30 minutes of manual programming time per new board inspection</li><li>Valuable engineer hours consumed by programming tasks</li><li>Delayed new product introduction (NPI) cycles</li><li>Main inspection systems tied up with programming instead of production</li></ul><p>Additionally, the customer wanted to avoid dedicating their main inspection systems solely to programming, as that further reduced operational efficiency.</p><h3>Fermi Vision's Solution</h3><p>Fermi Vision deployed an advanced system with two key innovations:</p><h4>1. CAD Auto-Programming Engine</h4><p>Working directly with the customer's design department, Fermi Vision developed a workflow where:</p><ul><li>CAD data could be directly ingested</li><li>Complete inspection programs were automatically generated</li><li>Manual setup was nearly eliminated</li></ul><h4>2. Distributed Offline Programming</h4><p>Fermi Vision provided an offline programming module compatible with local network environments. This enabled:</p><ul><li>Engineers to write, review, and optimize inspection programs from any PC in the factory</li><li>Inspection machines to focus on production use only</li><li>Greater flexibility in workflow management</li></ul><h3>Results</h3><p>The implementation delivered dramatic improvements across multiple metrics:</p><ul><li>Programming Time Reduction: Programming time fell from ~30 minutes per board to under 5 minutes in most cases</li><li>Higher Equipment Utilization: With offline capabilities, inspection machines could focus on measurement, not setup</li><li>Scalability and Consistency: New board types could be onboarded faster, with less training and lower risk of inconsistency</li></ul><h3>Industry Impact: Raising the Bar</h3><p>While many vision systems still rely on static programming models and disconnected workflows, Fermi Vision's approach demonstrates what's possible when modern software engineering meets precision hardware.</p><p>In this case, the transformation included:</p><ul><li>Integration with upstream design tools eliminated redundancies</li><li>Software automation empowered operators and engineers alike</li><li>Flexibility unlocked full equipment ROI, even in high-mix environments</li></ul><p><em>This is not merely an upgrade to traditional metrology—it's a transformation of how factories approach dimensional inspection.</em></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>As demand for speed, flexibility, and traceability grows in electronics manufacturing, Fermi Vision continues to lead with solutions that redefine expectations.</p><p>In this Shenzhen facility, what once took hours now takes minutes—without sacrificing accuracy. For manufacturers dealing with growing complexity, Fermi Vision delivers the next generation of scalable, intelligent inspection.</p><div class=\"contact-info\"><p>Learn more at: <a href=\"https://www.fermivision.com\">www.fermivision.com</a> or contact <a href=\"mailto:sales@fermivision.com\">sales@fermivision.com</a> for a demo.</p></div>"

        "content": "<h3>Executive Summary</h3><p>As global PCB suppliers face increasingly diverse compliance requirements, the ability to adapt inspection protocols quickly is essential. In this case, a Zhuhai-based PCB factory was tasked with dimensionally verifying export-bound boards under both old and new U.S. standards for curvature and positioning. Competing systems required separate modules or entirely new equipment to support different benchmarks—slowing throughput and inflating operational costs.</p><p>Fermi Vision delivered a system that supported multi-standard inspection out of the box and provided custom point-cloud fitting logic within 10 days. Inspection cycle times dropped from 30 minutes to 5 minutes per board. The result: a fast, standards-compliant, future-ready solution.</p><h3>Challenge: Fragmented Standards, Slow Systems</h3><p>The customer's legacy systems—ranging from OGP to regional brands—could not reconcile curvature definitions or reference fitments across multiple versions of U.S. standards. Engineers were manually inspecting each board in 30-minute cycles, using outdated software that lacked advanced alignment logic.</p><p>Some vendors proposed new software modules at extra cost; others lacked support for anything beyond one specific standard.</p><h3>Solution: Universal Compliance with Fast Customization</h3><p>Fermi Vision's platform shipped with native support for both old and new curvature and positional benchmarks. Within days, the engineering team added custom algorithms for 6-point reference fitting based on point-cloud data, providing a robust benchmark for evaluation. No external plugins were needed.</p><h3>Results</h3><ul><li>Measurement Time: Reduced from 30 minutes to just 5 minutes per board</li><li>Compliance: Passed all dimensional and positional tests across multiple U.S. standard versions</li><li>Adaptability: Delivered custom logic in under 10 days, without requiring additional hardware or licensing</li></ul><p>Fermi Vision proved not only faster but dramatically more versatile than legacy systems—delivering compliance without compromise.</p><div class=\"contact-info\"><p>Learn more at: <a href=\"https://www.fermivision.com\">www.fermivision.com</a> or contact <a href=\"mailto:sales@fermivision.com\">sales@fermivision.com</a> for a demo.</p></div>"
